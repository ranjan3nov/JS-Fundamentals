# JS and Classes

#### 1.Classes as Syntactic Sugar:

- Classes were introduced in **ECMAScript 2015 (ES6)** to provide a cleaner syntax for creating objects.
- However, they are not fundamentally different from the **_prototype-based approach_** JavaScript has always used.
- Classes are essentially a way to define a blueprint for creating objects with shared properties and methods.

#### 2. Prototype-Based Inheritance:

- JavaScript relies on prototypes for inheritance, unlike class-based **_languages like Java and C++_**.
- Every object in JavaScript has a prototype, which is another object that it inherits properties and methods from.
- When you create a class, you are defining the prototype for objects of that class.

## Object

- collection of properties and methods
- ex: toLowerCase, toUpperCase

## Need of OOP

## parts of OOP

### Object Literal means just Object

- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)

## 4 Pillars of JS

- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

##### NEW keywords

- Empty Object are created called as Instances
- Constructor function is called due to new keywords pack all the argument and pass to the function or methods
- all arguments are injected within this keywords
